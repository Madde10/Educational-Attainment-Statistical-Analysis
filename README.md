# Educational-Attainment-Statistical-Analysis
This project investigates the impact of socio-economic factors and parental education on the educational attainment of individuals in the U.S. Given the pivotal role education plays in fostering economic and social mobility, understanding these relationships is essential for designing effective policies and interventions.

Leveraging data from the High School and Beyond (HS&B) survey, which tracked high school sophomores and seniors starting in 1980 through follow-ups into the mid-1980s, this study analyzed 4,739 individuals to identify trends and predictors of educational achievement. Variables such as parental education, socioeconomic status, urbanicity, and proximity to educational institutions were considered for their potential impact on educational outcomes. Advanced statistical techniques, including Poisson and Quasi-Poisson models for count data and ordered logistic regression for categorical outcomes, were employed to dissect these influences.

Analysis revealed significant predictors of educational attainment. Parental education emerged as a crucial factor, with children of college-educated parents more likely to achieve higher educational levels. Socioeconomic indicators such as home ownership and family income were also significant, suggesting that economic stability provides a conducive environment for educational achievement. Conversely, higher tuition costs and greater distance from educational institutions were barriers to higher education.


This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing educational attainment in the U.S., offering valuable insights for policymakers and educators aiming to enhance educational equity and socio-economic mobility.
